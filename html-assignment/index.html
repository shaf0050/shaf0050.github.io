            <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
            <p>Hi, I am <em><strong>Nitheesh Shafi Kumar</strong></em>. You can call me by my first name (Nitheesh). I
                am from <strong>Kerala</strong>, a small
                state in India that is popular for its hill stations, coconut trees, tea plantations, and beautiful
                backwaters. Kerala is also known for its food variety. I completed my <strong>Bachelor's degree in
                    Multimedia</strong> in
                the year 2018.</p>

            <p> I have been working in the media field for the past five years. I have also worked as a
                <strong><em>Graphic Designer</em></strong>
                <abbr title="Crystal Printing Press">CPP</abbr> in Bahrain from 1<sup>st</sup> November 2018 to
                5<sup>th</sup> November 2019. I've also proved my worth in photography as I am also a freelance
                photographer.
                My main hobby is to explore new places and, I spend my leisure time shooting photographs.

            </p>
