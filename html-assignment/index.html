            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Nitheesh Shafi Kumar. You can call me by my first name (Nitheesh). I am from Kerala, a small
                state in India that is popular for its hill stations, coconut trees, tea plantations, and beautiful
                backwaters. Kerala is also known for its food variety. I completed my bachelor's degree in Multimedia in
                the year 2018.

                I have been working in the media field for the past five years. I have also worked as a graphic designer
                in Bahrain for a year. I've also proved my worth in photography as I am also a freelance photographer.
                My main hobby is to explore new places and, I spend my leisure time shooting photographs.
